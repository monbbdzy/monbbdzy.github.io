        At <span class="violet-text">NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD)</span>, the free-roaming cats arenâ€™t just campus residentsâ€”theyâ€™re silent observers, deep thinkers, and perhaps even philosophers in fur. As they lounge in the sun, wander through courtyards, or curiously watch students, one canâ€™t help but wonder: <span class="italic-text">Whatâ€™s on their minds? Are they contemplating the meaning of life, plotting their next adventure, or simply judging our late-night study sessions?</span> Cared for through feeding initiatives and veterinary support, these feline thinkers add warmth, mystery, and a touch of humor to campus life. They remind us that even in the busiest places, thereâ€™s always time to pause, observe, andâ€”maybeâ€”outsmart the humans.</div>

                <p>The video material depicts different cats on the campus imagining what the cats might be thinking about. An Iphone 15 pro max was used to shot the video and record the sound of the video. For editing the video, Cap Cut editing mobile app was used. Video was created by Nigina and Noma in span of 1 hour! It was chosen as the most interesting video and even received a chocolate from our professor :)</p>
